## Inspiration
We wanted to provide an easy way to view current and past New York Times Best Sellers.
## What it does
You can create and account and login, view current and past NYT Bestsellers by category, and add and remove favorited books. You can view every book's details, which includes the cover image, title, author, rank, description, and an amazon url. 
## How we built it
We built this using Java GUI and we used the New York Times Books API to get our data. 
## Challenges we ran into
- We couldn't get the layout managers in GUI to do what we wanted it to do.
- Finding an API: at first, we wanted to get the Barnes and Nobles API, but we had trouble getting an API key.
- We couldn't get the json package to work for a long time.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Sucessfully made the images we added to our GUI look decent.
2. Completed the project.
## What we learned
1. We have solidified our belief that Java is not for design.
2. Managing API data using json
3. Different manager layouts in Java GUI
## What's next for NYT Bestselling Books
- Using SQL to save and retrieve user account data
- Using websites to display rather than GUIs
- Adding more features (able to preview the book, export your favorite list, etc...)
